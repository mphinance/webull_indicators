This Pine Script indicator, developed for the TradingView platform, is a comprehensive "Advanced Trading Blueprint" that combines multiple technical analysis tools into a single, highly customizable script. It is a compilation of various indicators, including elements from the Saty Pivot Ribbon, TaoAwesomeness, and Tao Rainbow scripts.

Core Features:
EMA Ribbon System: The indicator includes a ribbon system based on Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), with a ribbon effect created by filling the space between the 8, 21, and 34 EMAs. It also plots the 55 and 89 EMAs for additional trend analysis.

Moving Averages (MAs) Lines: It allows plotting up to five Moving Averages simultaneously. Users can select from various types, including RMA, SMA, EMA, WMA, HMA, and VWMA, and customize the length and color for each.

VWAP with Standard Deviation Bands: The script includes a Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) line and plots up to three standard deviation bands around it.

Keltner Channel & RSI Entry Triggers: This feature uses the 21 EMA as the middle line for Keltner Channels, with bands based on ATR. It also includes a 2-period RSI for bullish and bearish entry triggers.

Pivot Levels: The indicator can plot various types of pivot levels, such as Traditional, Fibonacci, Woodie, and more. These levels can be calculated based on daily, weekly, or other timeframes.

Inflection Zones (Supply & Demand): It identifies and draws supply and demand zones based on swing high and low points. It also has a feature to mark "Breaks of Structure" (BOS) when a zone is broken.

Vector Zone: This component uses volume and candle spread to identify and color "vector" candles. These are bars with unusually high volume or momentum, highlighted in various colors to indicate strong bullish or bearish movement.

Zig Zag Line: A simple Zig Zag line can be enabled to help visualize price swings.

Customization:
The script offers extensive customization through the settings menu, allowing users to enable or disable different sections and adjust parameters for each component.

Compilation:
The script was compiled by @mphinance and "Combined by AI," as noted in the credits.
