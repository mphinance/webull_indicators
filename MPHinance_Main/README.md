This repository contains custom indicators and scripts for financial analysis, primarily developed for the Webull platform.
This particular one was borrowed from the link below, and rewritten by yours truly for Webull Desktop.

Using the 8, 21, and 34 EMA, the ribbons will change after a crossover. 
50 and 200 SMA crossover with a light shade is included as well, with a 100 SMA white line.

## Screenshots of Indicator in Action

Below are some screenshots demonstrating the indicator's appearance on various assets and timeframes.

These first 3 examples are $HOOD. When a stock is trending like this, I go down to the 1h, 15m, and 5m.

### HOOD - 1 Hour

### HOOD - 5 Minute

### HOOD - 15 Minute

$SPY on 6/25 - date of this writing, which was a huge range day.

### SPY - 3 Minute

Stocks like $TSLA that swing drastically, I look for entries on the 4h and Daily charts.

### TSLA - 4 Hour

### TSLA - Daily

Finally, it's important to play with different timeframes, and see how different lines react.
Here was a surprise - a hard rejection multiple times off the 100 SMA on the 1h chart.

### HOOD - 100 SMA
